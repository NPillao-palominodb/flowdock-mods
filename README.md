About
=====

This is a user stylesheet for the OS X Flowdock application. It re-styles the list of chats(flows) as a vertical list on the left hand side of the screen.

Installation
============
Add the ```userstyle.css``` file to ```~/Library/Application Support/Flowdock``` to unlock a vertical list of flows.

By default, OS X hides the Library directory in the user's home directory. This leaves two easy ways to copy the userstyle.css file.

Terminal
--------
1. Open the Terminal application.
2. Browse to the directory that contains the userstyle.css file.
3. Copy userstyle.css using the following command:

```cp userstyle.css ~/Library/Application\ Support/Flowdock```

Finder
------
1. Open the finder.
2. Press ```cmd + shift + g``` to open the 'Go to the Folder' dialog.
3. Paste ```~/Library/Application Support/Flowdock``` into the dialog.
4. Copy the userstyle.css file to the opened directory.
